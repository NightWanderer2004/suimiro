### {{ title }}

Today, May 18, 2022 - I turned 18 and decided to tell you about my start in programming!

#### Begining - python

In programming, I have been around for 2 years, at first I started learning python, but I had no idea where I could apply it and I didn't even understand where I could apply programming. For about 2 months I wrote in python, but then I decided to try myself in game development.

#### Unity and C#

I started learning Unity and C #, I was interested in game development on Unity and C #, I spent the whole summer making games and at the same time I was getting deeper into the basics of programming (functions, loops, etc.), I liked doing this because I could create something of my own, in my own style. I made a few games, but I didn't like them, so I decided to stop and start learning something new.

#### Frontend (begining)

Winter 2020 has come, more precisely December, I didn't program all autumn, so I started to be interested in what else I could develop besides games.
I wanted to start developing websites, I found a playlist on youtube and started to dive in. As I remember, at the beginning I watched the playlist from "Glo Academy", but it was from 2018 and it seemed outdated to me, so I found another playlist from "–§—Ä–∏–ª–∞–Ω—Å–µ—Ä –ø–æ –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏" and I'm grateful to the author of this playlist for a good base in HTML and CSS, but I didn't even look at JS for some reason.
I spent about 2 months learning only HTML and CSS, and then I started to do 1-2 simple orders on freelance, but at some point I just stopped and decided to drop it until mid-2021.

#### Frontend (course)

So its a July 2021, I find a frontend course in my city, I sign up and go to the first lesson, I knew that the first lessons would be about what I already know (HTML, CSS...), but I still decided to go from the beginning, to get acquainted with the people who also decided to go on this course.
As I remember, at the beginning there were 11 people, no one could really understand whether it was worth it or not. But I knew that I would get to the endüòé.
By the time I finished the course, only 4 people remained, I was the best in the group, I felt how my teacher hinted at this.

#### My teacher

Eugeniy Stupachenko - my teacher and just a cool guyüòâ, he taught me the basics of JS, React and even the MERN stack, for which I'm very grateful to him, the lessons with him were like family, it was always fun to learn and perform interesting homework. He always could joke and it was in place, he told me about ways to do a task with the help of knowledge that I have now.
I think that I have never had such a desire to perform work as qualitatively as possible, as I can, all because my teacher was with me!

#### What about now?

Now I'm good at React and MERN, I already created a whole application on this stack. I'm also learning new tools and working on this blog on 11ty and helping my friend in learning programming.

Enjoy frontend every minute, that's fun!
